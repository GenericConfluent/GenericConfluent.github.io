# Welcome

I do things with computers. That's about the gist of it. My interests span
graphics, machine learning, pure math, competitive programming, music, and
fitness. I'm fairly mediocre in most of those domains as a person would tend
to be after doing each one more or less for an extended period of time.

You'll find one off thoughts and projects that I engage with under the `blog`
section. And a more formal syntesis of topics that I decided I needed to write
down under my `notes`. I generally tend to work in an incremental way on stuff
so the way I "publish" my stuff reflects that&mdash;content will change
frequently to add thoughts I left out initially, add visuals, or maybe even just
finish the post. Some things may never be finished.

If something you were looking for randomly dissapeared try
grepping through the git history, the site is versioned and the source is
